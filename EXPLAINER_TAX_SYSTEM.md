# Understanding Your New AI-Powered Tax Compliance System

You recently asked: *"What is the AI Tax Form and TOI Plan, and how do I use it?"*

This guide explains the two major systems now live in your dashboard: (**TOI & ACAR**) and the new (**Living Tax Form**).

---

## 1. What is the "Living Tax Form"? (BETA)

The **Living Tax Form** is a revolutionary new way to handle tax compliance that moves away from static paper forms.

### **The Problem**
Traditional tax software uses "Hardcoded Forms" (PDFs or static inputs). If the tax law changes (e.g., GDT adds a new "Export Tax" field), the software breaks, and developers must rewrite code.

### **The "Living Form" Solution**
Your new system is "Alive". It does not have a fixed layout.
*   **AI-Driven Structure**: The AI Agent ("GK Blue") decides what the form looks like based on *your data*.
*   **Self-Healing**: If the Agent scans your ledger and sees "Export Revenue" (Account 41002), it *instantly rewrites the form structure* to include a "Zero-Rated Sales" section. You don't need a software update—the form adapts in real-time.
*   **Real-Time "Neural Link"**: The form is connected to the Agent's brain via a live socket. When you click "Auto-Fill", you watch the AI type in the numbers live.

### **How to Use It**
1.  Go to **Dashboard** > **Living Tax Form** (BETA Card).
2.  You will see a blank or default tax template (e.g., "Monthly Prepayment of Profit Tax").
3.  Click the **"Auto-Fill (AI)"** button in the top right.
4.  **Watch Magic Happen**:
    *   The status bar will change: *"Agent Analyzing Ledger..."*
    *   Numbers will appear in the fields.
    *   If the AI detects complexity (like Exports), the form layout might suddenly *change* to add new rows.
    *   The Agent will chat with you: *"I detected exports, so I added a section for VAT 0%."*

## 2. What is the "TOI Plan"?

**TOI** stands for **Tax On Income** (Annual Profit Tax).
The "TOI Plan" is the roadmap to automate your Annual Tax Return (Form T-01/T-02) using your General Ledger data.

### **Current Status: Hybrid Phase**
We are currently in a transition phase between **Visual Compliance** (The old way) and **Agentic Compliance** (The new way).

#### **A. The "TOI & ACAR" Module (Visual Compliance)**
*   **Button**: "TOI & ACAR" Card on Dashboard.
*   **What it is**: A digital overlay on top of the actual *Physical Paper Forms* (images).
*   **Purpose**: Use this for **Final Review** and **Printing**. It ensures the output looks exactly like the government paper form.
*   **How to use**:
    1.  Select "TOI Form".
    2.  Browse through the pages (Page 1, 2, ...).
    3.  You can type into the boxes manually.
    4.  Click **"Ask Blue Agent to Fill"**: It uses heuristics to guess years and basic data.

#### **B. The "Living Form" Module (Agentic Compliance)**
*   **Button**: "Living Tax Form" Card.
*   **Purpose**: Use this for **Calculation & Logic**. The AI does the heavy math here because it's not constrained by the physical paper layout.
*   **Goal**: The AI calculates the numbers in the *Living Form*, and then (in the next update) will *push* those final numbers into the *TOI & ACAR* visual forms for printing.
