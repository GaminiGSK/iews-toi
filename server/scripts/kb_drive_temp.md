# Blue Agent Knowledge Base
This folder contains resources for the Blue Agent (AI) to learn about the tax forms and project logic.

## Project Structure
- **/server**: Express.js backend with agents (Analyst, Tax, Ingestion).
- **/client**: React frontend for the Tax Workspace.
- **/knowledge**: Guidelines and structural definitions.

## 21 Forms Detected
I have successfully indexed 21 form pages in the `TOI FOAM` subfolder:
- 1-1.jpg through 22-1.jpg

## AI Objectives
1. **Digitization**: Convert these JPG samples into high-fidelity React components (LiveTaxWorkspace.jsx).
2. **Data Consistency**: Ensure TIN (4-box-9-box) and Khmer formatting match these official standards.
3. **Logic Training**: Use these forms to understand the flow of the TOI 01 annual return.

## Visual Standards
- Use **Glassmorphism** for headers.
- Use **Kantumruy Pro** for Khmer text.
- Follow the exact government official layout seen in these scans.
