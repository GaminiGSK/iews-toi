Chapter 9: Bank reconciliations
1.4 Format of a bank reconciliation statement
The purpose of a bank reconciliation is to show that the cash at bank account balance in the general ledger agrees with the bank statement balance after taking account of timing differences and making adjustments for any omissions or errors.
There is no single correct format for a bank reconciliation.
A useful approach is to correct the cash at bank balance for any omissions or errors and then adjust the balance per the bank statements for uncredited lodgements and unpresented cheques. The resultant balances should be the same.
Illustration: Bank reconciliation
The following assumes that the cash balance is positive (i.e. the business has a debit cash balance).

|                                                               |      |
| :------------------------------------------------------------ | :--- |
| **Balance per general ledger cash at bank account:**           | X    |
| Items in bank statement not in cash book:                     |      |
| Bank charges                                                  | (X)  |
| Dishonoured cheques                                           | (X)  |
| Interest received                                             | X    |
| Error (made by business)                                      | (X)  |
| Corrected cash at bank figure                                 | X/(X) |
|                                                               | X1   |
| **Balance per bank statement**                                | X    |
| Items in general ledger not in bank statement                 |      |
| Add: Outstanding lodgements                                   | X    |
| Deduct: Unpresented cheques                                   | (X)  |
| Corrected balance per bank statement                          | X1   |
| The balances (X1) should now agree                            |      |
