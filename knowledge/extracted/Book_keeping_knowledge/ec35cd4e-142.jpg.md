TQ1: Bookkeeping, controls and accounting

3.2 Method 1: the 'two accounts' method
This is the easier approach. Also note that it is the method used in computerised accounting systems.
The prepayment is estimated and then transferred from the expense account to a prepayment account:

Illustration: Prepayment using two accounts.

|                              | Debit | Credit |
| :--------------------------- | :---- | :----- |
| Prepayment account (an asset) | X     |        |
| Expense account                |       | X      |

The prepayment is a credit entry in the expense account therefore reducing the expense recognised in the current period.

The debit balance on the prepayments account is included in the statement of financial position as a current asset.

Example: Year 1
Meng Nhean sets up in business on 1 January Year 1 preparing financial statements to 31 December each year.

On 1 March he obtains annual insurance on his office building, starting from 1 March at cost of 2.4 KHRm, payable annually in advance.

10 months of the insurance cost relates to the current financial period (Year 1) and 2 months of it relates to insurance in the next financial year (January and February Year 2).

The charge to the statement of profit or loss for insurance in Year 1 should therefore be 2 KHRm (2.4 KHRm x 10/12).

The prepaid expense for Year 2 is 0.4 KHRm (2.4 KHRm × 2/12).

Method 1: two accounts approach

|             | Insurance expense             |      |
| :---------- | :---------------------------- | :--- |
| Year 1      |                               | KHRm |
| Bank        |                               | 2.4  |
|             | Prepayments                   | 0.4  |
|             | Statement of profit or loss   | 2.0  |
|             |                               | 2.4  |
|             |                               |      |
| **Year 1** | **Prepayments account**       |      |
|             |                               | KHRm |
| Insurance expense        |        0.4                         | Closing balance c/d        | 0.4  |
| Opening balance b/d |                               | 0.4  |
|                               |  0.4                             |      |
