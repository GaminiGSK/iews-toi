TQ1: Bookkeeping, controls and accounting

**Example:**
Mao Pheakdei sets up in business on 1 January Year 1. The business has a 31 December year end.

The business acquired a telephone system on 1 February.

Telephone charges are paid every 3 three months in arrears and telephone invoices received in Year 1 are as follows:

|             | KHRm  |
|-------------|-------|
| 30 April    | 5,000 |
| 31 July     | 7,500 |
| 31 October  | 8,500 |

To calculate the telephone expenses for Year 1, it is necessary to estimate the expense for November and December, and to make an accrual.

The next invoice (at the end of January Year 2) is expected to be 9 KHRm.

The accrual for November and December Year 1 should be 6 KHRm (9 KHRm × 2/3).

This can be represented as follows:

Year ending 31st December

30th April 30th June 31st Oct 31st Jan Estimate

=5 m = 7.5 m = 8.5 m = 9.5 m

Company owes 2/3 of 9 m = 6 m
This is a liability. It is called an accrual

∴ Expense for the year = 5 m +7.5 m + 8.5 m+ 6 m accrued = 27 million KHR

There are two ways of accounting for accruals at the end of an accounting period. These will be explained in turn.
