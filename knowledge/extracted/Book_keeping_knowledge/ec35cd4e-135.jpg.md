**Chapter 6: Accruals and prepayments**

**2.2 Method 1: the 'two account' approach for accrued expenses (accruals)**

This is the easier approach. Also note that it is the method used in computerised accounting systems.

The accrued expense is recorded in an accrued expenses account. The double entry for this adjustment is as follows

**Illustration: Accruals using two accounts.**

|                 | Debit | Credit |
|-----------------|-------|--------|
| Expense account | X     |        |
| Accruals account |       | X      |

This adds the accrued expense to the expenses recognised as the result of having received invoices earlier in the current accounting period.

The credit balance on the accruals account is a liability, and is included in the statement of financial position as a current liability.

**Example (continued): Year 1**

Payments in the year were:

|         | KHRm |
|---------|------|
| 30 April   | 5    |
| 31 July    | 7.5  |
| 31 October | 8.5  |

The accrual for November and December Year 1 is 6 KHRm (9 KHRm × 2/3).

|---------------------------------------------|------|--------------------------------|------|

| Bank                                        | 8.5  |                                |      |
| Accrued expense (accruals account)          | 6    |                                |      |
|                                             | 27   |                                | 27   |

**Accruals account**

| Year 1              | KHRm |                      | KHRm |
|---------------------|------|----------------------|------|
| Closing balance c/d | 6    | Telephone expenses   | 6    |
|                     | 6    |                      | 6    |
| Year 2              |      | Opening balance b/d  | 6    |

The expense in the statement of profit or loss for Year 1 is 27 KHRm and the accrued expense of 6 KHRm is included in the statement of financial position as a current liability at the end of Year 1.
