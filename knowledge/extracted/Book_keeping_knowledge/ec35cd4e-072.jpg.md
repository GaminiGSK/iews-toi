**2.5 Receivables control account**

A receivables ledger control account is the name given to the account in the general ledger for total receivables. A control account is an account that records total amounts – in this case, total amounts for receivables.

The receivables ledger control account records all transactions involving credit customers.

*   Debit entries in the receivables control account are transactions that add to the total amount of receivables.
*   Credit entries in the receivables ledger control account are transactions that reduce the total amount of receivables.

**Dishonoured cheques**

These are cheques received from customers where subsequently the bank refuses to make payment.

When a business receives a cheque from a customer it recognises that as an amount paid. If the business presents the cheque to the bank for payment and the bank refuse to accept it (perhaps because of insufficient funds in the customer's account) the business is still owed the money and must reverse the original entry (Dr Receivables, Cr Bank).
