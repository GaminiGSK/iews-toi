1.  1 **Introduction**

A business might make all its sales for cash but many businesses make some or even all their sales on credit. There is often no alternative to offering credit to customers. If competitors offer credit, then a business will have little alternative but to offer credit as well so as not to lose customers. A major benefit of offering credit is that it usually increases revenue, compared to what revenue would be if all sales were for cash.

If sales are made on credit, there is always a chance that some customers will fall into financial difficulty and be unable to pay what they owe.

It would be misleading to the users of the financial statements if a business continued to show receivables where there is no chance, or only a slight chance of collecting them.

The application of the concept of prudence would require that there should be an adjustment to reflect the fact that there are some receivables which the business thinks that it will not recover.

There are two categories of problem receivables for which adjustment might be required.

**Bad debts (also known as irrecoverable debts or receivables)**

A bad debt is an amount owed by a customer that the business believes it will never be able to collect.

Examples of circumstances that might lead to the conclusion that a receivable is irrecoverable include:

*   The bankruptcy or insolvency of a customer.
*   The death of a customer who has left insufficient assets to pay off his debts.
*   A dispute with a customer over whether a contract has been fulfilled or not.
*   The dishonesty of a customer (where a person has obtained goods on credit with no intention to pay).

**Doubtful debts**

A doubtful debt is an amount owed by a customer that the business believes might prove difficult to collect but they still hope to do so. For example, the business might know that the customer is in difficulty but that he might be able to work his way out of it. This casts doubt on the collectability of the receivable but it still might be possible if the customer is able to recover from his difficulties.
