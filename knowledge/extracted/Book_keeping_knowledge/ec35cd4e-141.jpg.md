Chapter 6: Accruals and prepayments

**3 PREPAYMENTS**

**Section overview**

*   Prepayments (prepaid expenses)
*   Method 1: the 'two accounts' method
*   Method 2: the 'one account' method

**3.1 Prepayments (prepaid expenses)**

Prepaid expenses are expenses that are recorded in the accounts in the current period, because a purchase invoice has been received or a payment has been made, but all or part of the expense relates to a future accounting period.

Prepaid expenses occur whenever payments are made in advance for an expense item.

To apply the accruals basis of accounting, the expenses that have been recorded in the accounts but that relate to a future accounting period should be:

*   excluded from the expenses in the statement of profit or loss for the current year and recognised as an asset (a prepayment) at the year-end; and then
*   included in the expenses for the next financial period (which is the period to which they relate).

**Example: Year 1**

Meng Nhean set up in business on 1 January Year 1 preparing financial statements to 31 December each year..

On 1 March he obtains annual insurance on his office building, starting from 1 March at cost of 2.4 KHRm, payable annually in advance.

10 months of the insurance cost relates to the current financial period (Year 1) and 2 months of it relates to insurance in the next financial year (January and February Year 2).

The charge to the statement of profit or loss for insurance in Year 1 should therefore be 2 KHRm (2.4 KHRm x 10/12).

The prepaid expense for Year 2 is 0.4 KHRm (2.4 KHRm x 2/12).

This can be represented as follows:

Year ending 31st December 20X1

Period covered by insurance

Cost this year is 10/12 of 2.4 million = 2 million

Company is owed 2/12 of 2.4 million = 400,000.

This is an asset. It is called a prepayment

There are two ways of accounting for prepayments at the end of an accounting period. These will be explained in turn.
