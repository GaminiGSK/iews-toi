At the end of the financial year, the closing inventory is physically counted and
valued. The closing inventory double entry is then processed.

|                                            | Debit | Credit |
| :----------------------------------------- | :---- | :----- |
| Inventory (statement of financial position) | X     |        |
| Cost of sales (Statement of profit or loss) |       | X      |

In summary

Opening inventory in the trial balance (a debit balance) and purchases (a debit
balance) are both transferred to cost of sales.

This clears both accounts.

Closing inventory is recognised in the inventory account as an asset (a debit
balance) and the other side of the entry is a credit to cost of sales.

Cost of sales comprises purchase in the period adjusted for movements in
inventory level from the start to the end of the period.
