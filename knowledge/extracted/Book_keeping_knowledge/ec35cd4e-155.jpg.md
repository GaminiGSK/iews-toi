Chapter 7: Depreciation

**Example: Reducing balance method**

A machine cost 100 million KHR. It has an expected life of five years, and it is to be
depreciated by the reducing balance method at the rate of 30% each year.
Annual depreciation and carrying amount over the life of the asset will be as
follows.

| Year | Carrying amount at start of year | Annual depreciation charge (at (30% of the reducing balance) | Carrying amount at end of year |
|---|---|---|---|
|   | KHRm | KHRm | KHRm |
| 1 | 100 | 30 | 70 |
| 2 | 70 | 21 | 49 |
| 3 | 49 | 14.7 | 34.3 |
| 4 | 34.3 | 10.29 | 24.01 |

**Practice questions**

**1** An item of equipment cost 1,260,000 KHR. It has an expected useful
life of six years and an expected residual value of 240,000 KHR. Using
the straight-line method of depreciation:

What is the annual depreciation charge?

What will be the carrying amount of the asset after four years?

**2** The financial year of a company is 1st January to 31st December. A
non-current asset was purchased on 1st May for 60,000 KHR. Its
expected useful life is five years and its expected residual value is zero.
It is depreciated by the straight-line method.

Complete the following ledger accounts for Years 1 and 2 and calculate
the carrying amount of the asset at the end of each period.
**a** equipment account
**b** accumulated depreciation of equipment account
**c** depreciation of equipment account

**3** A non-current asset cost 64,000 KHR. It is depreciated by the reducing
balance method, at the rate of 25% each year.

Complete the following ledger accounts for Years 1, 2 and 3 and
calculate the carrying amount of the asset at the end of each period.

**a** equipment account

**b** accumulated depreciation of equipment account

**c** depreciation of equipment account
