**2.1** Debit and credit entries, and *T* accounts

Financial transactions are recorded in the accounts in accordance with a set of rules or conventions. The following rules apply to the accounts in the main ledger (nominal ledger or general ledger).

*   Every transaction is recorded twice, as a debit entry in one account and as a credit entry in another account.
*   Total debit entries and total credit entries must always be equal. This maintains the accounting equation.

It therefore helps to show accounts in the shape of a *T*, with a left-hand and a right-hand side. (Not surprisingly this presentation is known as a *T account*). By convention:

*   debit entries are made on the left-hand side and
*   credit entries are on the right-hand side.

|                             |                                   | debit entry is made         |
|                             |                                   | X                           |

By convention, the terms 'debit' and 'credit' are shortened to 'Dr' and 'Cr' respectively.

**Alternative presentation**

Accounts might also be presented in columnar forms. If this presentation is used care must be taken over the meaning of debit and credit in the context of the account. For example, a debit in a credit account would be shown as a deduction. In other words, it is easier to make mistakes with this format. However, it can be useful when you want to show a single account or use a single account as a working. You will see examples of this presentation in later chapters but for now we will only use *T accounts*.
