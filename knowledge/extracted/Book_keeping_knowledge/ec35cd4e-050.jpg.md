**5.1 Introduction**

The general ledger is a document which contains all of the individual accounts which are used to record the double entries of a business. It may have physical form as a book or it may be a software application.

All of the financial transactions of a business are entered into appropriate accounts in the general ledger. The balances on these individual accounts can be extracted as a trial balance as a step in preparing financial statements for the business.

Usually a business will organise its general ledger into the specific accounts which it uses. As part of this process, it might employ a coding system under which each individual ledger account is assigned a unique code.

The list of these codes is called a chart of accounts.

**5.2 Codification and a chart of accounts**

A chart of account is a list of accounts created by a business to be used to organise its financial transactions into identified categories of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.

**Codification**

Each general ledger account is identified by a unique code and heading. This allows a business to generate instructions and policies to be followed by those members of staff responsible for recording information.

Codification also allow the designations of transactions to the correct accounts.

The list is typically arranged in the order of the customary appearance of accounts in the financial statements, statement of financial position general ledger accounts followed by statement of profit or loss general ledger accounts. The structure and headings in the list aim to result in consistent posting of transactions.

A company might have complete freedom in designing its chart of accounts (within the boundaries set by the rules of accounting). In some countries, the government might issue a generic chart of accounts from which a business selects those codes that are appropriate to its needs.

The aim of the chart is to ensure that all transactions are recognised in accordance with the requirements of the business.
