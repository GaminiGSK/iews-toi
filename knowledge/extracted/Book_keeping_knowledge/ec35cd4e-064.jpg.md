TQ1: Bookkeeping, controls and accounting

Illustration: Credit note
A issues an invoice to a customer for 200,000 KHR.

A later agrees to reduce the amount payable by 10,000 KHR because some of the
goods were of poor quality.

A issues a credit note to the customer for 10,000 KHR.

The customer is now required to pay 190,000 KHR which is the invoice for
200,000 KHR less the credit note for 10,000 KHR.

2.2 Recording sales
i
Sales day book

The sales day book is one of the books of prime entry. It is used to make an
initial record of sales on credit. Credit sales transactions are entered in the sales
day book as a list.

Double entry and updating the receivables ledger

Periodically (daily, weekly, monthly) a total for all transactions is posted to sales
and the receivables control account in the general ledger, and the individual
amounts used to update the customers' individual balances in the receivables
ledger.

*   The total value of the transactions (since the previous time that entries
    were posted to the ledger) is transferred as a double entry to the general
    ledger:
*   Each individual transaction is transferred to the receivables ledger and
    recorded in the account of the individual customer which is debited with the
    value of the transaction.

|                     | Debit | Credit |
| :------------------ | :---- | :----- |
| **General ledger:** |       |        |
| Receivables control account| X     |        |
| Sales               |       | X      |
|                     |       |        |
| **Receivables ledger:** |       |        |
| Individual customer accounts| X     |        |

There is a diagram showing an overview of this system together with the
purchases and cash system at the end of this chapter.

Responsibilities

The duty of the main accountant is to maintain the general ledger and extract
financial information from it. The main accountant will also oversee accounting
assistants (accounts clerks) whose duties are to maintain the day books,
subsidiary ledger and thus the list of balances.
