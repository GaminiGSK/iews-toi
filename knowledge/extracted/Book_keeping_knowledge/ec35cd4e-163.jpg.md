1.1 Receivables control account

Chapter 3 explained that sales and purchases transactions are recorded in day
books. The totals from the day books are posted to control accounts in the
general ledger. These are supported by a separate record which is a list of
individual balances that comprise the total in the general ledger.

A control account is an account which represents a total value of a number of
separate balances.

The receivables control account

The receivables control account is an account for recording the value of
transactions in total with credit customers. The balance on the receivables control
account (debit balance) is the total amount currently owed by all customers.

The receivables control account will contain some or all of the totals to date for all
of the following postings to the account.
