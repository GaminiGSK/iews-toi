**Exam context**

This is a very important chapter. It explains basic double entry bookkeeping, a skill that is fundamental to the work of a bookkeeper.

Questions on topics in this chapter will often require calculations. In the exam you may be required to:

*   Specify the double entry needed to record particular transactions
*   Use ledger accounts to identify balancing figures
*   Identify the journal that correctly accounts for a given scenario

**Tutor tips**

Learn the meaning of debit and credit entries in the context of different types of account (e.g. a debit entry reflects an increase of an asset or a decrease of a liability). Try to think of this in terms of your knowledge of the accounting equation.

Make sure that you completely understand how to balance off an account and what a debit balance or credit balance might mean and how they can be used to generate a trial balance. If double entry has been performed properly (i.e. every debit has been matched by a credit) the trail balance should balance. If it does not then something has gone wrong.

Make sure that you know what a journal entry is (a simple way of stating a double entry) and what the journal is (a book or a file which provides a record of many double entries).

You must fully understand the vital role played by the general ledger. It includes all the individual accounts of the business. All transactions are double entered in these accounts which can be balanced off in order to form a trial balance. This is a vital step in preparing financial statements.
