Chapter 6: Accruals and prepayments
3.3 Method 2: the 'one account' method
This approach is trickier to understand. The prepayment is recognised in the expense account.

There are two ways of achieving this.

*   The total expense can be calculated and transferred to the statement of profit or loss (Dr Statement of profit or loss; Cr Expense account) leaving a balancing figure on the expense account as a prepayment; or
*   The prepayment can be calculated and recognised in the expense account leaving the amount transferred to the statement of profit or loss (Dr Statement of profit or loss; Cr Expense account) as a balancing figure.

Example: Year 1

Meng Nhean sets up in business on 1 January Year 1 preparing financial statements to 31 December each year..

On 1 March he obtains annual insurance on his office building, starting from 1 March at cost of 2.4 KHRm, payable annually in advance.

10 months of the insurance cost relates to the current financial period (Year 1) and 2 months of it relates to insurance in the next financial year (January and February Year 2).

The charge to the statement of profit or loss for insurance in Year 1 should therefore be 2 OKHRm (2.4 KHRm x 10/12).

The prepaid expense for Year 2 is 0.4 KHRm (2.4 KHRm × 2/12).

Method 2: one account approach

|                  |                | Closing balance c/d (prepayment)    | 0.4            |
|                  |                |                                       | 2.4            |
|                  |                | 2.4                                 |                |
| Year 2           |                |                                       |                |
| Opening balance b/d | 0.4            |                                       |                |

The expense in the statement of profit or loss is 2 KHRm and the prepaid expense is included in the statement of financial position as a current asset at the end of Year 1.

There is no need to reverse the prepayment using the one account method as it is already in the expense account at the start of the next year.
