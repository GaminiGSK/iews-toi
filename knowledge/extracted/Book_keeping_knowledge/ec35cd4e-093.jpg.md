Section overview

- Summary of journal entries under each system
1.1 Recording inventory
In order to prepare a statement of profit or loss it is necessary to be able to
calculate gross profit. This is done by comparing the sale proceeds from the sale
of items of inventory to the cost of those items. This is an application of the
accruals concept (matching principle).
In order to calculate gross profit it is necessary to record opening inventory,
purchases and closing inventory.
There are two main methods of recording inventory.
- Periodic inventory method (period end system)
- Perpetual inventory system
Each method uses a ledger account for inventory but these have different roles.
A question on year-end adjustments for inventories will normally require you to
use the periodic inventory method but the perpetual inventory system is
examinable in its own right.
1.2 Periodic inventory method (period-end method): accounting procedures
This system is based on the use of two ledger accounts:
- Purchases account which is used to record all purchases during the year; and
- Inventory account which is used to record the value of inventory at the
beginning/end of the financial year.
It operates as follows:
Year 1
A business starts on 1 January Year 1. This business has no opening inventory.
All inventory purchased in the year to 31 December Year 1 is recorded in the
purchases account.
Illustration: Purchases through the year
|                    | Debit | Credit |
| :----------------- | :---- | :----- |
| Purchases          | X     |        |
| Cash or liabilities |       | X      |

At the end of the year a trial balance is extracted. One of the balances in the trial
balance is the purchases figure for the year.
