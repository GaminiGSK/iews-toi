6 RAISING FINANCE
Section overview
*   Introduction
*   Accounting for formal sources of finance
*   Accounting for informal sources of finance
6.1 Introduction
Business entities often need to raise from external sources.
Many entities have access to the formal financial markets. The main formal
sources of finance include:
*   borrowing from a financial institution;
*   borrowing from the owner(s); and
*   for companies, issuing new shares to the existing owners or new owners
Many businesses may not have ready access to formal sources of finance. For
example, small agricultural businesses might operate in rural areas with no local
branch of bank. Such businesses might raise cash from informal sources of
finance, for example:
*   friends or family members;
*   money lenders; or
*   extended credit from suppliers.
6.2 Accounting for formal sources of finance
Loans
Accounting for loans is straightforward.
Illustration: Loan double entry

|                       | Debit | Credit |
| :-------------------- | :---- | :----- |
| Bank (cash received)  | X     |        |
| Loan liability        |       | X      |

The borrower would also have to account for interest on the loan.

|                    | Debit | Credit |
| :----------------- | :---- | :----- |
| Interest expense   | X     |        |
| Cash (or liability) |       | X      |
