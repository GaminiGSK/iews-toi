## 1.2 Accruals and prepayments

### Accruals

A business might incur an expense before the year end but not receive an invoice until after the year-end. If this is the case the business must estimate the amount of the expense and recognise it as an expense and a liability.

The liability is known as an accrual. The business is said to be making an accrual for the expense or accruing for the expense.

### Prepayments

A business might pay or at least be invoiced for some expenses in advance.

When the invoice is received the business will recognise the full liability as a debit in an expense account. It would be wrong to then clear all of this to the statement of profit or loss in the current period. Some of it relates to the next period. This part must be recognised as an asset (it represents a right to receive some kind of service in the next period) called a prepayment.

There are two approaches to accounting for both accruals and prepayments:

*   Method 1 – using two accounts; and
*   Method 2 – using one account.

Each of these will be explained in turn.
