TQ1: Bookkeeping, controls and accounting

There are some types of error that do not result in a difference between total
debit and total credit entries and therefore do not affect the balancing of the trial
balance. For example:
*   A transaction might have been omitted entirely from the general ledger,
    with no debit entry and no credit entry.
*   The wrong figure might be double entered.
*   Transactions might be recorded in the wrong account. For example, the
    cost of repairing a machine might be recorded incorrectly as a debit in the
    machinery at cost account instead of recording it as a debit in the machine
    repairs account. The amount of the debit entry is correct; the error is to post
    the transaction to the wrong account.
*   There might be compensating errors. For example one error might result in
    debits exceeding credits by 2,000,000 KHR but another error might result in
    credits exceeding debits by 2,000,000 KHR. If this happens, the errors will
    'cancel each other out' and will not be apparent from a check on the trial
    balance totals for debits and credits.
