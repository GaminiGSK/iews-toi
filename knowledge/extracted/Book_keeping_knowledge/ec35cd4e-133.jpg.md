## 2.1 Accruals (accrued expenses)

A business might incur expenses during a period but may not have been sent the invoice by the period end.

Since there has been no payment and no invoice, a financial transaction has not yet occurred and there is not yet anything to record as a bookkeeping entry in the ledgers. However, to apply the accruals basis of accounting, the expense must be charged in the statement of profit or loss for the accounting period to which the expense relates. This is done by creating an accrued expense at the end of the accounting period.

An accrued expense (accrual) is an estimate of the cost that has been incurred in the financial period, and it is included in expenses in the statement of profit or loss for the period and recognised as a liability (called an accrual) in the statement of financial position.

Accruals are often necessary when expenses are paid in arrears (i.e. at the end of a period of expense).
