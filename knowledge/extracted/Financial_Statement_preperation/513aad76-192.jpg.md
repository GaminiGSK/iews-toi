TQ5: Financial statement preparation
Example: Cash paid for property, plant and equipment

PM company has purchased various items of property, plant and equipment on
credit during the year. The total purchased was 60 KHRm.

The statements of financial position of PM company at the beginning and end of
20X9 include the following information:

|               | 20X8    | 20X9    |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| Payables:     |         |         |
| Suppliers of non-current assets | 4 KHRm  | 12 KHRm |

The cash paid to buy property, plant and equipment in the year can be
calculated as follows:

|                                                      | KHRm |
|------------------------------------------------------|------|
| Additions                                            | 60   |
| Less: increase in payables that relate to these items | (8)  |
| Cash paid in the year                                | 52   |

This can be thought of as the payment of the 4 KHRm owed at the start
and a payment of 48 KHRm towards this year's purchases.

If the payables had decreased the movement would be added to the additions
figure to find the cash outflow.
