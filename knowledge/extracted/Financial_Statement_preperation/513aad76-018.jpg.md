TQ5: Financial statement preparation
Format of a statement of financial position
A simple statement of financial position is divided into two parts:
*   The top half of the statement shows the assets of the business, with non-current assets first, and current assets below the non-current assets.
*   The lower half of the statement shows equity, followed by liabilities. The liabilities are shown with non-current (long-term) liabilities first, and then current liabilities.
The figure for total assets in the top part of the statement must always equal the total of equity plus liabilities in the bottom half.

The statement of financial position is not a statement of value.
The value of a business is determined by the profits that the business is expected to generate using the assets that it owns. There is no way of telling what a business is worth by looking at the financial statements. (Further analysis would be required to arrive at a valuation).
