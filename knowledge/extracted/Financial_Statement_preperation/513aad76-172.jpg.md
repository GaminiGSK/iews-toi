TQ5: Financial statement preparation

**Example:**

A company disposed of an item of equipment for 40 KHRm. The equipment had
originally cost 60 KHRm and the accumulated depreciation charged up to the date
of disposal was 32 KHRm.

|                            | KHRm  |
| -------------------------- | ----- |
| Cost                       | 60    |
| Accumulated depreciation   | (32)  |
| Carrying value at date of disposal | 28    |
| Cash proceeds from sale    | (40)  |
| Gain on disposal           | 12    |

In the statement of cash flows, the gain on disposal of 12 KHRm is deducted as an
adjustment to the operating profit.

The cash proceeds of 40 KHRm is included as a cash inflow under the heading:
'Cash flows from investing activities'.

**3.3 Accruals based figures - Interest**

The accruals concept is applied in accounting.

Interest charge in the statement of comprehensive income is an accrual based
figure. It is added back to profit and the actual cash interest paid is deducted
further down the statement of cash flows.

The final items in the operating cash flows part of a statement of cash flows are
the amount of interest paid and the amount of tax paid (see later).

This figure must be calculated as follows:

**Illustration:**

|                                                              | KHR |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --- |
| Interest liability at the beginning of the year              | X   |
| Interest charge for the year (statement of comprehensive income figure) | X   |
|                                                              | --- |
|                                                              | X   |
| Interest liability at the end of the year                   | (X) |
| Interest paid in the year (cash)                             | X   |
|                                                              | --- |

The interest liability at the start of the year and the interest charge during the year
is the most the business would pay. If the business had paid nothing it would owe
this figure. The difference between this amount and the liability at the end of the
year must be the amount that the business has paid.

**An aside - taxation paid**

The tax paid is the last figure in the operating cash flow calculation.

There is no adjustment to profit in respect of tax. This is because the profit figure
that we start with is profit before tax; therefore tax is not in in it to be adjusted!
