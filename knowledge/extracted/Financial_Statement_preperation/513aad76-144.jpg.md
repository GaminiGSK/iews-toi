TQ5: Financial statement preparation

## 4.2 Special funds
An organisation might also have other funds in addition to the accumulated fund.
These "special" funds arise in a number of circumstances including:
*   when an organisation receives cash for a designated purpose; or
*   when an organisation sets aside resources for a designated purpose.
The organisation might also set aside assets (say cash) to match to the fund so
that they can be used for the specified purpose.

Illustration: Receipt of cash for a specified purpose

|                     | Debit | Credit |
| :------------------ | :---- | :----- |
| Cash                | X     |        |
| Special fund        |       | X      |
| Allocation of assets to the fund |       |        |
| Special fund cash   | X     |        |
| Cash                |       | X      |

The following journals reflect cash being spent on the specified purpose.

|                                           | Debit | Credit |
| :---------------------------------------- | :---- | :----- |
| Special fund                              | X     |        |
| Cash (or "Special fund cash" if so allocated) |       | X      |

Example: Special fund

Ali has been very successful in business.

When he was a young man he very much enjoyed playing football and has very
fond memories of his days at the village football club.

He has donated 10,000,000 KHR to the club to fund the building of a new club
house.

This would be accounted for as follows:

|                         | Debit       | Credit      |
| :---------------------- | :---------- | :---------- |
| Cash                    | 10,000,000  |             |
| Special fund (clubhouse) |             | 10,000,000  |
| Allocation of assets to the fund  |   |             |
| Special fund cash       | 10,000,000  |             |
| Cash                    |             | 10,000,000  |
