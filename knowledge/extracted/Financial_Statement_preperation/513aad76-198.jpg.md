### 7.1 Cash from new share issues
The cash raised from new share issues can be established by comparing the equity share capital and the share premium in the statements of financial position at the beginning and the end of the year.

**Illustration:**
```
Share capital + Share premium at the end of the year     KHR
Share capital + Share premium at the beginning of the year      X
Cash obtained from issuing new shares in the year     X
```

**Example:**
The statements of financial position of P Limited at 1 January and 31 December included the following items:

|                       | 1 January 20X9 KHRm | 31 December 20X9 KHRm |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| Equity shares of 100,000 KHR each | 600,000             | 750,000              |
| Share premium           | 800,000             | 1,100,000            |

The cash obtained from issuing shares during the year is calculated as follows.
```
Share capital + Share premium at the end of 20X9   KHRm
Share capital + Share premium at the beginning of 20X9    1,850,000
= Cash obtained from issuing new shares in 20X9    1,400,000
                                                                 450,000
```
