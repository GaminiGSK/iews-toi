Chapter 3: Revision of double entry and accounting systems
There must also be individual accounts for each credit suppliers in a separate
payables ledger.
The payables control account will contain some or all of the totals to date for all of
the following postings to the account.

There must be individual accounts for each supplier in a separate payables
ledger.

**Payables control account reconciliation**

A payables control account reconciliation involves a comparison between the
totals on the payables control account and the list of balances in the payables
ledger.

The two totals should be equal after all corrections have been made. If a
difference still remains between the totals, this means that at least one error
remains undetected.

**3.3 Errors and suspense accounts**

As explained earlier, a trial balance is a useful check of double entry errors in the
accounting system.

Errors must have occurred if the total of debit balances and total of credit
balances on the general ledger accounts are not equal.

Having identified that an error (or more than one error) exists, the task of the
bookkeeper is to find the cause of the error and correct it.

**Types of error**

| Type of error                               | Comment                                                                                                   |
| :------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Errors of transposition (transposition errors) | Entering digits in a number in the wrong order (e.g. recording 9,700 KHR as 7,900 KHR.)               |
| Errors of omission                          | Failing to record a transaction (on both sides or one side of double entry)                              |
| Errors of commission                        | Recording an entry in the wrong account (e.g. debiting telephone expense to the electricity expense account). |
| Errors of principle                         | Recording an entry in the wrong type of account (e.g. recording capital expenditure as revenue expenditure). |
