These journals are only given to explain the double entry required. You should never write something like this in a preparation of financial statements question. It uses up too much time. You want to do double entry rather than write journals.

The chapter continues to show two possible approaches that you might follow, each using the information from the above journals. You do not have to use either approach. If you decide on a way that suits you then use it.

If you attend courses, your lecturers will show you how to do this. They are very experienced. Do as they advise.
