Definition
Working capital is current assets less current liabilities.
The previous section showed that taxation and interest cash flows can be
calculated by using a figure from the statement of comprehensive income and
adjusting it by the movement on the equivalent balances in the statement of
financial position.
This section shows how this approach is extended to identify the cash generated
from operations by making adjustments for the movements between the start and
end of the year for:
*   trade receivables and prepayments;
*   inventories; and
*   trade payables and accruals.
Assuming that the calculation of the cash flow from operating activities starts with
a profit (rather than a loss) the adjustments are as follows:

| Balance     | Increase in balance from start to the end of the year | Decrease in balance from start to the end of the year |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Receivables | Subtract from profit before tax                     | Add back to profit before tax                      |
| Inventory   | Subtract from profit before tax                     | Add back to profit before tax                      |
| Payables    | Add back to profit before tax                      | Subtract from profit before tax                      |

These are known as the working capital adjustments and are explained in more
detail in the rest of this section.
