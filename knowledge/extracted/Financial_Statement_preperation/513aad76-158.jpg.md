TQ5: Financial statement preparation

**Example (continued): Memorandum cash and bank account**
The drawings for the year can be calculated as the balancing figure in a cash and bank memorandum account.

**Cash and bank memorandum account**

|                         | KHR m |                         | KHR m  |
| ----------------------- | ----- | ----------------------- | -----  |
| Opening balance, cash in hand | 200   | Payments to suppliers | 17,100 |
| Opening balance, bank   | 2,300 | Payments to employees | 12,800 |
| Receipts                | 42,800| Payments of interest/bank charges | 400  |
|                         |       | Drawings (= balancing figure) | 11,000 |
|                         |       | Closing balance, cash in hand    | 500    |
|                         |       | Closing balance, bank   | 3,500  |
|                         | 45,300|                         | 45,300 |

The same calculation could be presented in a vertical format, as follows:

|                                                            | KHR m     |
| :--------------------------------------------------------- | :-------- |
| Cash in hand and bank at the beginning of the year          | 2,500     |
| Receipts during the year                                     | 42,800    |
|                                                            | 45,300    |
| Payments to suppliers                                        | 17,100    |
| Payments to employees                                        | 12,800    |
| Payments for interest/bank changes                           | 400       |
| Total payments recorded                                    | (30,300)  |
| Cash in hand and bank at the end of the year                  | 15,000 |
| Difference = missing figure = drawings | (4,000) |
|                                                            | 11,000    |

2.  4 **Cost structures**

Missing figures can sometimes be estimated by using cost structures which describe the relationship that exists between sales, cost of sales and gross profit.
The relationship between revenue and cost of sales can be expressed as a percentage.

There are two ways of doing this:

*   Gross profit is expressed as a percentage of cost of sales – this is known as mark-up; or
*   Gross profit is expressed as a percentage of sales - this is known as profit margin.
