## 2.3 Notional interest on long-term capital

The partnership contract might provide for the partners to obtain notional interest on the long-term capital they have invested in the business. This is interest on the balance in their capital account.

Notional interest on long-term capital is not interest expense, because the capital in the partners' capital account is equity, not a liability of the business.

The notional interest is a share of the partnership profits. Like notional salaries, the notional interest is awarded to each partner in accordance with the partnership contract.

The residual profit shared between the partners in the profit-sharing ratio is the profit after notional salaries and notional interest on capital are deducted.

**Example:**

Partnership DEF has three partners, D, E and F.

Partner D has contributed 100 KHRm of fixed capital, Partner E 120 KHRm and Partner F 60 KHRm.

They have agreed to share profits in the following way.

1.  Partner D to receive a salary of 4 KHRm and Partner F a salary of 7 KHRm.
2.  All three partners receive interest at 5% on the fixed capital contributed.
3.  Residual profit or loss to be shared between D, E and F in the ratio 3:5:2.

The profit of the partnership for the year is 95 KHRm.

The partnership profits would be shared between the partners as follows:
