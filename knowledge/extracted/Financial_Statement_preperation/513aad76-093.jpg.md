Chapter 5: Preparation of company financial statements
Further requirements of CIAS 1 include the following:
Financial statements should present fairly the financial position, financial
performance and cash flows of the entity.
Comparative information for the immediately preceding accounting period
should be disclosed (you will not be asked to provide comparative
information).
Each component of the financial statements must be properly identified with
the name of the reporting entity and the date of the end of the reporting
period or the period covered by the statement, whichever is appropriate.

1.3 Current and non-current assets
CIAS 1 rules that current and non-current items should normally be presented
separately in the statement of financial position, so that:
current and non-current assets are divided into separate classifications;
and
current and non-current liabilities are also classified separately.
As a general rule, an amount is 'current' if it is expected to be recovered or
settled no more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period.
CIAS 1 states that an asset should be classified as a current asset if it satisfies
any of the following criteria:
The entity expects to realise the asset, or sell or consume it, in its normal
operating cycle.
The asset is held for trading purposes.
The entity expects to realise the asset within 12 months after the reporting
period.
It is cash or a cash equivalent unless the asset is restricted from being
used for at least 12 months after the reporting date. (Note: An example of
'cash' is money in a current bank account. An example of a 'cash
equivalent' is money held in a term deposit account with a bank.)
All other assets should be classified as non-current assets.
This definition allows inventory or trade receivables to qualify as current assets,
even if they may not be realised into cash within 12 months, provided that they
will be realised in the entity's normal operating cycle or trading cycle.
The operating cycle of an entity is the time between the acquisition of assets for
processing and their realisation in cash or cash equivalents. When the entity's
normal operating cycle is not clearly identifiable, it is assumed to be twelve
months. This is almost always the case.
