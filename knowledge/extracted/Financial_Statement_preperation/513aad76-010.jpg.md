**Exam context**
This is a straightforward chapter.
It covers topics which are mentioned specifically in the syllabus but also some which are not.
These areas are covered to provide a proper foundation for the study of financial accounting.

Questions on topics in this chapter will be knowledge-type multiple choice questions. For
example, in the exam you may be required to:

*   Explain the importance of financial information to different types of user
*   Explain the meaning of GAAP
*   Explain the characteristics and purpose of the statement of financial position and the statement of comprehensive income.
*   List the components of a set of financial statements.
*   Describe the basic presentation layout of statements of financial position and statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
*   Identify duties and responsibilities of those charged with governance

**Tutor tips**

All business will prepare similar financial statements using a similar approach but financial reporting by companies is subject to much more regulation and are often more complex due to the volume and range of their transactions.

Make sure that you understand what financial accounting involves and how it differs from cost accounting and management accounting.

It is important to understand the objectives of financial statements. Learn the different user groups and the information they might need.

Later in the text you will learn much more about the statement of financial position and statement of profit or loss but this chapter provides a useful introduction which will help you put the content of later chapters into context.

The last section of the chapter gives very brief introduction to ethical behaviour. KICPAA in common with all professional accounting institutes strongly promotes the ethical strength of the profession. You will learn more about this in later papers.
