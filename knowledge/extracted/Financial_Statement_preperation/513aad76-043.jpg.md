### 2.1 The role of books of prime entry

Book-keeping is the process of recording financial transactions in the accounting records (the 'books') of an entity. Transactions are recorded in accounts, and there is a separate account for each different type of transaction.

It is often the case that individual transactions are not recorded in the ledger accounts as they occur. Instead, they are recorded initially in records called books of prime entry (also known as books of original entry). Each of these 'books' or 'journals' is used to record different types of transaction. Periodically the totals of each type of transaction are double entered into the appropriate ledger accounts in the general ledger.

Books of prime entry include the following:

| Book of prime entry     | Function                                                                                               |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sales day book,         | Records sales on credit (receivables) from sales invoices.                                            |
| Sales returns day book  | Records items returned by credit customers (credit notes issued to customers).                      |
| Purchases day book      | Records purchases on credit from suppliers (trade payables) from purchase invoices.                   |
| Purchases returns day book | Records returns of purchases on credit.                                                              |
| Cash book             | Records cash received into the bank account and cash paid out of the bank account. <br> Cash receipts and payments are very much a part of the sales and purchases cycles. |
| Journal               | Records transactions that are not recorded in any of the other books of original entry.               |

Books of prime entry are useful means of summarising large numbers of similar transactions like credit sales, credit purchases and cash and bank payments and receipts.
