Chapter 3: Revision of double entry and accounting systems

**Correcting errors where a suspense account is opened**

When it is clear that an error has occurred, it is often helpful to decide the answer to two questions:

*   Has the error resulted in different total amounts for debit and credit entries?
    *   If the answer is yes, making the correction will involve the suspense account.
    *   If the answer is no, the correction should be made, but will not involve the suspense account.
*   If the error has resulted in different total amounts for debit and credit entries, think about the general ledger account or accounts containing the error, and decide what needs to be done to correct the balance on that account.

For each account affected by an error, you can prepare two sets of memorandum T accounts for:

*   What accounting entries have been made in the accounts, and
*   What the accounting entries should have been.

By comparing what has been recorded in the accounts with what should have been recorded, you can then work out the double entry adjustments that are needed to get from 'where we are' to 'where we want to be'.

**Example:**

A payment to a supplier of 23,500,000 KHR has been recorded in the cash book/bank account in the general ledger but has not been recorded in the trade payables account.

As a result, total credits exceed total debits in the trial balance by 23,500,000 KHR and a suspense account must be opened with a debit balance of 23,500,000 KHR.

| **(1) What has been recorded** | **(2) What should have been recorded** |
| Trade payables account      | Trade payables account                |
| 0                           | 23,500,000                            |
| Suspense account            | Suspense account                      |
| 23,500,000                  | 0                                     |

This error would be corrected as follows.
