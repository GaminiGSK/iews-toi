Chapter 8: Preparation of accounts from incomplete records
2.3 Memorandum cash and bank account

A memorandum account may also be used to record transactions in cash (notes
and coins) and through the bank account, in order to establish a missing figure
for a cash payment or possibly a cash receipt.
You might be given figures for:
cash in hand and in the bank account at the beginning of the year;
cash in hand and in the bank account at the end of the year;
cash receipts (cash, cheques and other forms of receiving money);
payments during the period for purchases, salaries and other cash
expenses.
If there is a missing figure for a cash payment, this should emerge as a balancing
figure.

Note: Cash in hand consists of banknotes and coins. Often, it is just petty cash.
However, some businesses hold a large amount of cash in hand because they
sell goods for cash; for example, retail stores may hold fairly large quantities of
cash in hand.

Example: Memorandum cash and bank account
An accountant is trying to prepare the financial statements of a sole trader from
incomplete records.

A problem is that the owner of the business admits to having taken cash from the
business, but he has not kept a record of how much he has taken.
The accountant has established the following information:

|                                             | KHR m  |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Cash in hand at the beginning of the year   | 200    |
| Bank balance at the beginning of the year | 2,300  |
| Cash in hand at the end of the year         | 500    |
| Bank balance at the end of the year       | 3,500  |
| Receipts                                    | 42,800 |
| Payments to employees                       | 12,800 |
| Payments to suppliers                       | 17,100 |
| Payments of interest/bank charges           | 400    |

The cash drawn by the owner during the year can be calculated as follows.
