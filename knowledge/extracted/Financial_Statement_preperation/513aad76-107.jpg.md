Chapter 6: Preparation of partnership accounts
The accounts of the partnership must record the capital and profits that are
attributable to each individual partner.
The profit of a sole proprietor is simply added to the capital balance brought
forward. In the case of a partnership the profit belongs to the partners so there
must be a mechanism by which this is shared. Partners' shares are then added
to their personal capital accounts.
1.3 Partners' capital
Each partner contributes capital to the business and shares in the profit (or loss)
of the business. The capital of each partner must be identified separately.
The capital of each partner is usually contained in two accounts.
Capital account
Current account
Capital account
The partnership contract usually specifies that each partner must contribute a
minimum amount of 'fixed' capital and that partners cannot draw out any of their
fixed capital.
In addition, each partner might retain some of his or her share of accumulated
profits in the business. The partnership contract should allow partners to draw out
their share of accumulated profits, if they wish to do so.
The capital account records the fixed capital or long-term capital of the partner
that the partner must retain in the business and cannot take out in drawings.
The balance on this account does not change very often.
Current account
A current account is used to record the accumulated profits of the partner and the
partner's drawings.
The profits of the business are shared between the partners. The share of
each partner is credited to (added to) his or her current account.
Each partner may take drawings out of the business. Drawings are a
withdrawal of profit. These are recorded by debiting the current account of
the partner (and crediting the Bank account).
