5 DERECOGNITION OF NON-CURRENT ASSETS

Section overview
* Gain or loss on disposal of a non-current asset
* Accounting for the disposal of property, plant and equipment
* Disposal of property, plant and equipment: part-exchange of an old asset

5.1 Gain or loss on disposal of a non-current asset
Property, plant and equipment are eventually disposed of:
* by sale, or
* if they have no sale value, through disposal as scrap.

Disposal can occur at any time, and need not be at the end of the asset's
expected useful life.

The effect of a disposal on the statement of financial position (or accounting
equation) is that:
* the asset (at cost or valuation) is no longer in the statement of financial
position, and
* the accumulated depreciation on the asset is also no longer in the
statement of financial position.

The carrying amount of the asset is therefore removed from the accounting
equation.
There is a gain or loss on disposal of the asset, as follows:

Illustration: Gain or loss on disposal

|                                       |     KHR |    KHR |
| :------------------------------------ | ------: | -----: |
| Sale proceeds on disposal             |         |      X |
| Less Disposal costs                   |         |    (X) |
| Net disposal value                    |         |      X |
| Asset at cost                         |       X |        |
| Less: Accumulated depreciation        |     (X) |        |
| Carrying amount at date of disposal   |         |    (X) |
| Gain /loss on disposal                |         |      X |

Example: Gain or loss on disposal
A non-current asset originally cost 750,000 KHR. Accumulated depreciation is
510,000 KHR.

The asset is now sold for 180,000 KHR. Disposal costs are 5,000 KHR.
