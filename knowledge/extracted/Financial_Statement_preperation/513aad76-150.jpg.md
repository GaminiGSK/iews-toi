**2.1 The accounting equation**

The accounting equation is:

| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------- | :-------------------- | :-------------------- | :-------------------- |
| Assets = Liabilities + Equity                                                                      or | Assets - Liabilities = | Equity                  |                       |                       |
| A      =          L    + E                                                                             | A      -   L           | =  E                  |                       |                       |
|                                                                                                      | Net assets            |                       |                       |                       |

The accounting equation is an equation. Therefore changes in one side are matched by changes in the other side.

Profit or loss for a period can be calculated from the difference between the opening and closing net assets after adjusting for any drawings during the period.

| **Formula:**                     |
| :------------------------------ |
| Increase in net assets=Profit + capital introduced - drawings |

The profit figure can be calculated as follows:

| Closing assets - liabilities                                          | X    |
| Opening assets - liabilities                                          | X    |
| Increase/(decrease) in net assets in the period                       | X    |
| Add drawings                                                          | X    |
| Subtract new capital introduced by the owner(s)                       | (X)   |
| Balance = profit /(loss) for the year                               | X    |
