TQ5: Financial statement preparation

Example: Working capital efficiency ratios
The following information is available for Company Y for Year 1.

|                       | 1 January Year 1 | 31 December Year 1 |
| :-------------------- | :--------------- | :----------------- |
|                       | KHR m            | KHR m              |
| Inventory             | 300              | 360                |
| Trade receivables     | 400              | 470                |
| Trade payables        | 150              | 180                |

Sales in Year 1 totalled 3,000 million KHR and the cost of sales was 1,800 million KHR.

The Working capital efficiency ratios are calculated as follows:
**Efficiency ratios**
Average days to collect = [435 million/3,000 million] x 365 days = 52.9 days
Inventory turnover period = [330 million/1,800 million] x 365 days = 66.9 days
Average time to pay = [165 million/1,800 million] × 365 days = 33.5 days.

**Workings**
Average inventory = [300 million + 360 million]/2 = 330 million KHR
Average trade receivables = [400 million + 470 million]/2 = 435 million KHR
Average trade payables = [150 million + 180 million]/2 = 165 million KHR.

3.5 Cash operating cycle/working capital cycle

The cash operating cycle or working capital cycle is the average time of one cycle of business operations:
*   From the time that suppliers are paid for the resources they supply
*   To the time that cash is received from customers for the goods (or services) that the entity makes (or provides) with those resources and then sells.

A cash cycle or operating cycle is measured as follows:

Illustration: Cash operating cycle

|                                                       | Days/weeks/ months |
| :---------------------------------------------------- | :----------------- |
| Average inventory holding period                      | X                  |
| Average trade receivables collection period           | X                  |
| Average period of credit taken from suppliers         | (X)                |
| Operating cycle                                       | X                  |

The working capital ratios and the length of the cash cycle should be monitored over time. The cycle should not be allowed to become unreasonable in length, with a risk of over-investment or under-investment in working capital.
